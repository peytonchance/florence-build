  <h2 class="section-title">The Concept</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">Meet Florence</p>
  <p>Our explorations led to the concept of Florence â€” a personal companion that would help patients understand and manage their medication regimen.  A chatbot at heart, patients would converse with her through text and picture messages.</p>
  <p>If developed, a simple, familiar interface would hide her powerful intelligence. Behind the scenes, machine learning and behavioral modeling would enable her to offer a tailored, human experience based on each patientâ€™s needs.</p>

      <h3>She gets to know you.</h3>
      <p>Florence strikes up a conversation, learning details about your life, health, goals, and preferences in an engaging, human way.</p>
      <p>This conversation unfolds over time, making this feel less like twenty questions and more like the start of a relationship. </p>

    <div class="message">
      <ul>
        <li class="message-left">Hi! I'm Florence. What's your name?</li>

      <h3>She cheers you on.</h3>
      <p>Florence can send you occasional notes of encouragement to keep you motivated.</p>
      <p>For patients with asymptomatic conditions, this offers a sense of progress.</p>
