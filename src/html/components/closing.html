  <p>Our concept, Florence, attempts to address significant causes of non-adherence from a patient’s perspective, and through the use of technology.</p>
  <p>The problem of non-adherence, however is broader than those factors. This problem needs to be approached from multiple dimensions: socio-economic, education, healthcare access, and treatment models—to name a few. Technology is just one means of attack, not the only one.</p>
